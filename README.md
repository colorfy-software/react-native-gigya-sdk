[**`dataCenter`**](https://developers.gigya.com/display/GD/Finding+Your+Data+Center) (***both required***), app

```js
import GigyaSDK from 'react-native-gigya-sdk'

// Before anything we initialize the SDK
GigyaSDK.init({
  lang: 'en',
  apiKey: 'GIGYA_API_KEY',
  dataCenter: 'eu1.gigya.com',
  encryptedStorageKey: 'ENCRYPTED_STORAGE_KEY'
})

// Now we can use it
const myAccount = await GigyaSDK.login(email, password)
```
